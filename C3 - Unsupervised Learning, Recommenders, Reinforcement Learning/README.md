### Course Review :

This Course is a best place towards becoming a Machine Learning Engineer. Even if you're an expert, many algorithms are covered in depth such as decision trees which may help in further improvement of skills.

**Special thanks to [Professor Andrew Ng](https://www.andrewng.org/) for structuring and tailoring this Course.**

<br/>

Concluding, this is a course which I would recommend everyone to take. Not just because you learn many new stuffs, but also the assignments are real life examples which are *exciting to complete*.
